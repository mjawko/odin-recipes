    <p>Steps</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Layer 2 folded dish towels
                 on a cutting board and place
                  tofu on top. Place 2 more 
                  folded dish towels and a heavy
                   book on top. Press tofu for 5
                    to 10 minutes or longer. Cut
                    into bite-sized cubes.</li>
            <li>Heat a large nonstick pan over 
                medium heat. Add tofu and dry-fry
                 until golden on 1 side, about 5 
                 minutes. Flip and cook until golden
                  on the other side, about 5 minutes
                   more.</li>
            <li>While tofu is frying, whisk soy sauce
                , agave nectar, Dijon mustard, ginger,
                 sesame oil, and cayenne pepper together
                  in a bowl. Stir in the fried tofu, coating
                   thoroughly in the marinade. Cover the
                   bowl and refrigerate about 30 minutes 
                   or longer.</li>
            <li>Combine water and quinoa in a small saucepan
                 and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium 
                 and simmer until quinoa is fluffy and water 
                 has been absorbed, 13 to 15 minutes. Monitor 
                 the quinoa while it cooks; add extra water 
                 if necessary.</li>
            <li>While quinoa is cooking, place sweet potatoes 
                in a small saucepan and cover with 1 or 2 inches 
                of water. Bring to a boil and cook for 3 minutes. 
                Drain.</li>
            <li>Combine cooked quinoa, tofu and marinade, cooked 
                sweet potatoes, onion, and peanut oil in a large 
                frying pan over medium-high heat. Cook, stirring 
                constantly, until onion is soft, 3 to 4 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
