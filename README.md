It's Aplil 4th 14:53. It has been about 2 weeks from when I started leaning this thing. Now I can make repositories, Directories, super simple webpages by using html. I can use elements such as <p><h><ul><ol><li><a><img><em><strong>.

With this assingment throughout html;css;javascript, I want to be able to creat a webpage about veganism which is easy to use and visually great.
And want to be able to blind touch.
